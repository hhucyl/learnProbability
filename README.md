Probability and Statistics for Computer Scientists 2nd, computer project

This project is about the computer project behind the book Probability and Statistics for Computer Scientists 2nd. I have done some of the projects without guarantee the acurracy of the code. Comments are of great welcome to help me correct the code. 

network_monte_carlo is for the question:
5.9 Twenty computers are connected in a network. One computer becomes infected with a virus. Every day, this virus spreads from any infected computer to
any uninfected computer with probability 0.1. Also, every day, a computer technician takes
5 infected computers at random (or all infected computers, if their number is less than 5)
and removes the virus from them. Estimate:
(a) the expected time it takes to remove the virus from the whole network;
(b) the probability that each computer gets infected at least once;
(c) the expected number of computers that get infected.
The result is not in consistent with the answer

tree_monte_carlo is for the question:
5.10 A forest consists of 1,000 trees forming a perfect 50Ã— 20 rectangle,
Figure 5.8. The northwestern (top-left) corner tree catches fire. Wind blows from the west,
therefore, the probability that any tree catches fire from its burning left neighbor is 0.8.
The probabilities to catch fire from trees immediately to the right, above, or below are all
equal 0.3.
(a) Conduct a Monte Carlo study to estimate the probability that more than 30% of the
forest will eventually be burning. With probability 0.95, your answer should differ
from the true value by no more than 0.005.
The result is not in consistent with the answer
